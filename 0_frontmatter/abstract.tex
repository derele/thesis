  The ability to expand into new environments and niches, despite
  being highly adapted for survival in their habitual environment, is
  a fascinating feat of organisms. The propensity of
  \textit{Anguillicola crassus} to capture new hosts can serve as a
  model for an extreme case of this, in which parasites accquire new
  hosts. Selection in such new environments leading to adaptation is
  considered a driving force of divergence and thus for the origin of
  species and biotic diversity.

  Gene regulatory networks, as a bridge between genotype and
  phenotype, are thought to play a central role both in the response
  to stress (e.g. from sofar unexperienced environmental stressors)
  and in the divergence and eventually establisment of reproductive
  barriers between populations. An additional feature of parasite
  gene-expression is the theoretically deduced need to express only a
  single allele of a polymorphic parasite infection locus.

  In the present project the differences in gene-expression in
  \textit{A. crassus} populations should be illuminated. The parasite
  was introduced to Europe 30 years ago, spread successfully in a new
  host and established stable populations.
