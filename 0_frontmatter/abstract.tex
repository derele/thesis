  The ability to expand into new environments and niches, despite
  being highly adapted to a habitual environment, is a fascinating
  feat of organisms. 30 years ago \textit{Anguillicola crassus} has
  been introduced from Asia, where it parasitises \textit{Angilla
    japonica}, to Europe and spread here in the new host species
  \textit{Anguilla anguilla}. Whether and how much phenotypic
  plasticity or the rapid adaptation to differential selection are
  contributing to the success invading new host-populations is a
  question of big evolutionary interest.

  Gene regulatory networks, as a an important link between genotype
  and phenotype, are thought to play a central role both in the
  response to stress (e.g. from sofar unexperienced environmental
  stressors) and in local adaptation.

  In the present project differential gene-expression in
  \textit{A. crassus} populations was illuminated and genetic
  components of differences were isolated in cross-inoculation
  experiments with both Asian and European host-species and parasite
  populations.

  Several proteases were shown to be under positive seleciton on the
  sequence level, highlighting this group of enzymes as possible
  targets of an immune-attack on \textit{A. crassus}. On the
  gene-expression level the extent of heritable change was large in
  comparison to the effect of modification in different
  host-environments. Mitochondrially encoded subunits of the
  respiratory chain and other genes connected to aerobic respiration
  showed diverged expression patterns in European vs. Asian parasite
  populations, cuticle collagen genes showed ``adapted'' patterns of
  expression in host-parasites pairs of shared origin.
  
  These results identified gene-expression phenotypes, confirming the
  divergenece of European \textit{A. crassus} populations. These
  phenotypes will be more accessible than complex life history traits
  to popluation-genetic analysis linking them to slection.
