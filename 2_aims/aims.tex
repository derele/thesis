\section{Preliminary aims}

In order to investigate the response of the transcriptome to
environmental stimuli or alternatively, a genetic fixation of such a
response, the responding units (transcripts) had to be established
first. Ensuring the quality of these computationally constructed
transcript-models (contigs) and screening for host- and other
xenobiont-derived sequences were central aims of this preparatory part
of the project. These goals were pursued using bioinformatic analysis
of Sanger- and pyrosequencing data, with the aim of guaranteeing
reliable inference based on this reference data.

\section{Final aim}

Not only gene-expression studies were enabled based on the sequence of
this reference transcriptome, but also questions could be addressed
regarding general aspects of the evolutionary biology of
\textit{A. crassus}. Aims addressable at the sequence-level were the
characterisation of the transcriptome in relations to related
parasitic nematodes and the inference of positive selection using
data on polymorphism.

The genetic component of expression differences was then elucidated in
reciprocal transplant experiments. As the final aim of these
experiments, the relative contributions of physiological plasticity of
gene-expression versus rapid, heritable, evolutionary change will be
illuminated. If present, divergent expression phenotypes between
European and Asian populations would be found.
