Differential gene-expression in A. crassus populations was assessed using next generation sequencing on the 454 and Illumina platforms and genetic components of differences were isolated in cross-inoculation experiments with both Asian and European host-species and parasites. The extent of heritable change was large in comparison to the effect of modification in different host-environments. Subunits of the respiratory chain showed divergent expression patterns in European vs. Asian parasites.
