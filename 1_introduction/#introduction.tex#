\section{The study organism: \textit{Anguillicola crassus}} 

\subsection{Ecological significance} 

\textit{Anguillicola crassus} Kuwahara, Niimi and Ithakagi 1974
\cite{kuwahara_Niimi_Itagaki_1974, moravec_anguillicoloides} is a
swimbladder nematode naturally parasitizing the Japanese eel
(\textit{Anguilla japonica}) indigenous to East-Asia. After a single
introduction \cite{wielgoss_population_2008} to Germany in the early
1980s \textit{A. crassus} has colonized almost all populations of the
European eel (\textit{Anguilla anguilla})
\cite{kirk_impact_2003}. Since the 1990s populations of the American
eel (\textit{Anguilla rostrata}) have been colonized as novel hosts
\cite{fries_notes:_1996,barse_exotic_1999, barse_swimbladder_2001} and
finally it has been detected in three indigenous \textit{Anguilla}
species on the island of Reunion near Madagascar
\cite{sasal_parasite_2008}.\


In Asia, as well as in the introduced ranges, copepods and ostracods
serve as intermediate hosts of \textit{A. crassus}
\cite{moravec_first_2005}, in which L2 larvae develop to L3 larvae,
infective to the final host. Once ingested by an eel they migrate
through the intestinal wall and via the body cavity into the
swimbladder wall \cite{haenen_effects_1996}, i.a. using a trypsin-like
proteinase\cite{polzer_identification_1993}. In the swimbladder wall
L3 larvae hatch to L4 larvae. After a final moult from L4 to preadult
the parasites inhabit the lumen of the swimbladder, where they
eventually mate. Eggs containing L2 larvae are released via the ductus
pneumaticus into the eels gut and finally into the
water\cite{de_charleroy_life_1990}.\

Within the novel range and hosts, conspicuously elevated prevalences
and intensities of infection occur (reviewed in
\cite{kirk_impact_2003} and \cite{taraschewski_hosts_2007}). These
differences in abundance of \textit{A. crassus} in East Asia compared
to Europe are commonly attributed to the different host-parasite
relations in the final eel host permitting a differential survival of
the larval and the adult parasites
\cite{knopf_differences_2004}. Recently, data from experimental
infections of European eels with \textit{A. crassus} have been
published \cite{fazio_regulation_2008}. They show that the parasite
undergoes (under experimental conditions) a density-dependent
regulation keeping the number of worms within a certain range.\


\textit{Anguillicola crassus} Kuwahara, Niimi et Itagaki, 1974
\cite{kuwahara_Niimi_Itagaki_1974} is a nematode feeding on blood in
the swimmbladder of freshwater eels of the genus
\textit{Anguilla}. Originally endemic to East-Asian populations of the
Japanese Eel (\textit{Anguilla japonica}), \textit{A. crassus} has
attracted interest due to recent anthropogenic expansion of its
geographic- and host-range to Europe and the European eel
(\textit{Anguilla anguilla}). Soon after it had been recorded for the
first time in 1982 in North-West Germany \cite{fischer_teichwirt}, to
where it was most likely introduced by live-eel trade
\cite{koops_anguillicola-infestations_1989, koie_swimbladder_1991},
\textit{A. crassus} rapidly spread throughout populations of its newly
accquired host (for a review see \cite{kirk_impact_2003}). At the
present day it is found in all but the northernmost population of the
European eel in Iceland \cite{kristmundsson_parasite_2007}.

The impact of \textit{A. crassus} on the European eel has been a major
focus of research during the past decades. High prevalences of the
parasite of above 70\% (e.g. \cite{wrtz_distribution_1998}), as well
as high intesities of infections were reported, throughout the newly
colonized area \cite{lefebvre_anguillicolosis:_2004}.  Based on a
broad base of work on its epidemiology \textit{A. crassus} can be
regarded as a model for parasite introduction and spread
\cite{taraschewski_hosts_2007}.

As in the natural host in Asia prevalences and intesities are lower
\cite{mnderle_occurrence_2006}, high epidemiological parameters
were attributed to the inadequate immune-response of the European Eel
\cite{knopf_swimbladder_2006}. Interestingly the differences in the
two host also affect the size and life-history of the worm: In
European eels the nematodes are bigger and develop and reproduce
faster \cite{knopf_differences_2004}.  While the Japanese eel is
capable of killing larvae of the parasite after vaccination
\cite{knopf_vaccination_2008} or under high infection pressure
\cite{heitlinger_massive_2009}, only pathological effects such a
thikening of the swimmbladder wall \cite{wrtz_histopathological_2000}
have been found in the European eel.

Today, both theoretical arguments as well as field and laboratory data
suggest that evolution, including speciation, can occur very rapidly
given the right selective pressure. Such situations provide us with
the opportunity of examining how evolution and speciation work at the
molecular genetic level (Via 2002).


\subsubsection{Interest in \textit{A. crassus based on its
    phylogenetic position in the phylum nematoda}}

The genus \textit{Anguillicola} holds a phylogenetic position basal to
the Spirurina (clade III \textit{sensu} Blaxter
\cite{blaxter_molecular_1998}), one of 5 major clades of nematodes
\cite{nadler_molecular_2007, wijov_evolutionary_2006}. The Spirurina
exclusively exhibit a parasitic lifestyle and comprise improtant human
pathogens as well as prominent parasites of livestock (e.g. the
Filaroidea and Ascarididae). This phylogenetic position makes the
Anguillicoloidae an interesting system in the endeavour to understand
the emergence of parasitism in Spirurina and as an ``outgroup'' for
functional studies of parasitism in this clade. Some functionally
interesting genes in this respect are thought to be under diversifying
selection in an arms-race between host and
parasite\cite{zang_serine_2001}.



\subsection{Functional insights from other nematodes used to formulate
  hypotheses for \textit{A.crassus}}

The analysis of ESTs, especially in nematode parasites, has been
employed to identify pathogenic factors as potential vaccine
candidates in numerous studies. (Blaxter 1995; Blaxter et al. 1996;
Daub et al. 2000; Blaxter 2000; Harcus et al. 2004; Mitreva et
al. 2004a; Mitreva et al. 2004b; Mitreva et al. 2005).


The complete genome sequence of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
(The C. elegans sequencing consortium 1998) and Caenorhabditis
briggsae (Stein et al. 2003), as well as the draft genomic assembly of
Brugia malayi (Ghedin et al. 2007) provide useful sources for mining
databases for homologous sequences. Brugia


\section{Advances in sequencing technology enabeling this study}


Recent advances in sequencing technology (often termed Next Generation
Sequencing; NGS), provide the opprotunity for rapid and cost-effective
generation of genome-scale data.

    Research Institute, NHGRI}.}



\subsection{Pyro-sequencing}

The longer read length of 454-sequencing \cite{pmid16056220} compared
to other NGS technologies, allows \textit{de novo} assembly of
Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) in organisms lacking previouse genomic
or transcriptomic data (for a comprehensive list of studies using this
approach before Oct 2010 see \cite{pmid20950480}).

Such transcriptomic datasetes are still less expensive than genomic
data-sets in terms sequencing costs and analytical needs.


\subsection{Illumina-Solexa sequencing}

As shorter read-length but higher throughput of the Illumina-Solexa
platform provides superior means for gene expression analyis
\cite{pmid21627854}:

Expression-tags (SuperSAGE \cite{pmid20967605}) provide the benefit of
classical SAGE-analysis  .
