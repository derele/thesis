\section{Sanger-method pilot-sequencing}

One reason to sequence the libraries from the eels host was to
elucidate whether this contamination was nematode or species-typical
(e.g caused by poly-dT primers binding to A-rich rRNA regions), or
caused by shortcomings in the preparation.

Nevertheless the stringent quality trimming and processing of raw
reads, as summarized in the present document, make the remaining ESTs
a valuable resource for comparison with future 454-sequencing-data..
