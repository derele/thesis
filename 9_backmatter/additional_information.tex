\figuremacro{tGO_sex_BP_classic_10_all}{GO biological process graph
  for enriched terms in DE according to sex}{Subgraph of the
  GO-ontology biological process category induced by the top 10 terms
  identified as enriched in DE genes between male and female
  worms. Boxes indicate the 10 most significant terms. Box color
  represents the relative significance, ranging from dark red (most
  significant) to light yellow (least significant). In each node the
  categoy-identifier, a (eventualy truncated) description of the term,
  the significance for enrichment and the number of DE / total number
  of annotated gene is given. Black arrows indicate a is ``is-a''
  relationship.}

  for enriched terms in DE according to sex}{Subgraph of the
  GO-ontology cellular compartment category induced by the top 10
  terms identified as enriched in DE genes between male and female
  worms. Boxes indicate the 10 most significant terms. Box color
  represents the relative significance, ranging from dark red (most
  significant) to light yellow (least significant). In each node the
